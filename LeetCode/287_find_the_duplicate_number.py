        https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/discuss/73022/Python-Solution-with-O(1)-space-and-O(nlogn)-time

        The difficulty in this problem lies in O(1) space, and many solution using O(n) space can also be accepted by OJ.
        The solution is applying bi-search in the range[1, n] by counting the element which falls in sub range(n/2, n].
        If the number is bigger than capacity of that sub range, it means the duplicated integer falls in the sub-range.
        Otherwise the duplicated integer falls in the other half sub range.
