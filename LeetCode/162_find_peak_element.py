Basic Idea: Binary search

Elaboration: 
 if an element(not the right-most one) is smaller than its right neighbor, then there must be a peak element on its right, because the elements on its right is either 
   1. always increasing  -> the right-most element is the peak
   2. always decreasing  -> the left-most element is the peak
   3. first increasing then decreasing -> the pivot point is the peak
   4. first decreasing then increasing -> the left-most element is the peak  

   Therefore, we can find the peak only on its right elements( cut the array to half)

   The same idea applies to that an element(not the left-most one) is smaller than its left neighbor.



Conditions:
     1. array length is 1  -> return the only index 
     2. array length is 2  -> return the bigger number's index 
     3. array length is bigger than 2 -> 
           (1) find mid, compare it with its left and right neighbors  
           (2) return mid if nums[mid] greater than both neighbors
           (3) take the right half array if nums[mid] smaller than right neighbor
           (4) otherwise, take the left half
